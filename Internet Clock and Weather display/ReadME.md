This project is made for submission for our Graded Laboratory Project for Internet of Things lab, Semester 6 - (Jan - May 2019).



We created API's from different websites which spit out information (we already set to parse) when we send a HTTP 'GET' request to the API URL.

We used Thingspeak's ThingHTTP app to make this easy. We can create things from different websites' data and can 'GET' our info by pinging the generated URl with API key.

Below is the screenshot of my Thinhspeak profile's "ThingHTTP" app page:

The connections info is in the "Schematics" folder above. Fritzing files are uploaded above with the folder of same name.

Here is a quick connection diagram:
